I used to have an extensive collection of yara rules for a variety of things, from malware detection to detecting which version of a software something is based on diffing rules.

The yara community isn't shy to share these rules either.

But occassionally I have one or two that I need for hunting or tracking something specific so I created this repo to put specific ones of those online to contribute.
